Spam Email Classification Project

Introduction
Objective:
The goal of this project is to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning algorithms.
Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project (emails.csv) contains:
Features: The content of the email (text).
Target Variable: Whether the email is spam or not (spam).
Problem Statement:
Spam detection is crucial for email systems to reduce unwanted emails. Machine learning techniques are valuable because they can improve accuracy and efficiency in filtering spam.

Data Preprocessing
Loading the Data:
The dataset was loaded into a DataFrame using pandas. Data format requirements were met, and the necessary preprocessing steps were carried out.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Shape of the Dataset: The dataset's shape was checked using df.shape.
Column Names: Reviewed to understand the dataset features.
Duplicate Removal: Duplicates were removed to clean the data.
Missing Values: Checked for missing data using df.isnull().sum() (none found).
Text Processing and Cleaning:
The text preprocessing included:
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words.
Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation from the text.
Stopword Removal: Removing common English stopwords to reduce noise.
Stopwords Download: Used nltk.download("stopwords") to download the stopwords package.




Feature Extraction
Bag of Words (BoW) Using CountVectorizer:
The CountVectorizer was used to convert the text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning, with custom tokenization using the analyzer=process argument.

Splitting Data for Training and Testing
Train-Test Split:
The data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split, with an 80-20 ratio.
Shape of the Data:
Displayed the shape of the training and testing sets: xtrain, xtest, ytrain, and ytest.

Model Training and Evaluation
Naive Bayes Classifier
Model Training:
A MultinomialNB classifier was trained on the training data (xtrain, ytrain).
Training Set Evaluation:
Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated.
Confusion Matrix: Displayed and explained the confusion matrix, including true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Testing Set Evaluation:
The same evaluation metrics were presented for the testing set, and results were compared to the training set to assess potential overfitting or underfitting.

Summary of Findings:
The results of both models were summarized, discussing which model performed better on the test data.
Challenges and Limitations:
Challenges like class imbalance, data quality, and overfitting were discussed.
Future Work:
Potential improvements include:
Using more advanced models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests.
Trying different feature extraction techniques.
Applying hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
We must point out that logical registration is better than NB.
